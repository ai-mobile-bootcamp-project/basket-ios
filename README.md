# Basket for iOS

Offline-first grocery shopping lists: keep several lists, add items by hand or from the DummyJSON groceries catalog, tick them off aisle by aisle and always see what the trip costs. Lists live on the phone; only the catalog comes from the internet. English, Spanish and Arabic.

The designs are drawn Android-first; the iOS app uses the native equivalent of each control.

## Run it

Xcode 15.0+ (Swift 5.9) · iOS 16.0+ · iPhone, portrait.

1. Open `Basket.xcodeproj`, pick the **Basket** scheme and an iPhone simulator, and press ⌘R. Run the tests with ⌘U.
2. From the command line:

```sh
cd BasketCore && swift test                      # product-rule tests only
xcodebuild -project Basket.xcodeproj -scheme Basket \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build test CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

To run on a device, choose your team under Signing & Capabilities. `project.yml` regenerates an equivalent project with `xcodegen generate`.

## Project

- **Stack:** SwiftUI (`NavigationStack`) · Core Data with a programmatic model · `URLSession` async/await · `AsyncImage` + `URLCache` · `Localizable.strings` / `.stringsdict` · XCTest. No third-party dependencies.
- **Layout:** `Basket/` is the app (App, Theme, Components, Persistence, Network, Screens, Resources). `BasketCore/` is a Swift package with the product rules (`BasketRules.swift`) and their tests; its sources are also compiled into the app.
- **Data:** sample lists in `Basket/Resources/sample-data.json`; catalog from `https://dummyjson.com/products/category/groceries` (no key); `groceries.json` in the BasketCore tests is a saved response for tests only.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ios.yml` runs `swift test`, then builds and tests the app on an iPhone 15 simulator (Xcode 15.4) on every push.

## Testing tips

| To test | Do this |
|---|---|
| Offline | Device: Airplane Mode. Simulator: turn off the Mac's network, or Network Link Conditioner → 100% Loss |
| Spanish / Arabic | Settings → Language in the app |
| Dark theme | Settings → Theme → Dark in the app |
| Largest text | Settings → Accessibility → Display & Text Size → Larger Text; in the simulator, Xcode's Environment Overrides |
| Screen reader | VoiceOver (device), or the Accessibility Inspector (simulator) |
| First launch again | Delete the app and run it again |

## Tickets

31 bug reports and 5 feature requests. Tickets use the sample lists: tap **Get started** on first launch, or **Settings → Reset sample data**.

### Feature requests

#### BK-201 · New screen · Spending by aisle
*Requested by: PO*

**Why:** shoppers want to see where the money goes before they leave home.

**Where:** List detail → ⋮ → **Spending by aisle** opens a new screen. Back returns to List detail.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Top bar: back arrow, title **Spending by aisle**, subtitle with the list name.
- One row per aisle that has items (ticked and unticked), in the order of the Categories screen. Empty aisles are hidden.
- Each row: the category emoji (default categories only, hidden from the screen reader), category name, item count ("1 item", "4 items") and the aisle total at the end. An aisle with items without a price shows "+ 1 without price" under its total. An aisle where no item has a price shows "—" as its total.
- Footer: **Total**, which is always equal to the List detail total.
- An empty list shows "Nothing on this list yet".
- Light and dark theme; English, Spanish and Arabic (mirrored); works at the largest text size.

**Expected for Weekly shop**

| Aisle | Items | Total |
|---|---|---|
| 🍎 Fruit & veg | 4 items | $21.71 |
| 🍞 Bakery | 1 item | — (+ 1 without price) |
| 🥛 Dairy & eggs | 2 items | $8.68 |

| 🧃 Drinks | 1 item | $7.86 |
| 🧻 Household & pets | 1 item | $2.16 |
| **Total** | | **$45.84** |

**Strings**

| Key | English | Spanish | Arabic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menu item and title | Spending by aisle | Gasto por pasillo | الإنفاق حسب الممر |

#### BK-202 · New button · Untick all
*Requested by: PO*

**Why:** people reuse the same weekly list; after a trip they want every item back on the "to buy" side in one tap.

**Where:** List detail → ⋮ → **Untick all**, below Clear basket.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Disabled when nothing on the list is ticked.
- Unticks every item at once; the items go back into their aisles, and the Lists card shows "0 of 10 in basket".
- A message "3 items unticked" offers **Undo** for 5 seconds, which ticks exactly the same items again.
- The count is grammatical in every language ("1 item unticked").

**Strings**

| Key | English | Spanish | Arabic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menu item | Untick all | Desmarcar todo | إلغاء تحديد الكل |
| Message (3) | 3 items unticked | 3 artículos desmarcados | تم إلغاء تحديد 3 عناصر |

#### BK-203 · New functionality · Quick add on List detail
*Requested by: PO*

**Why:** adding an item through the full form takes too long in the store.

**Where:** a text field at the top of List detail, above the first aisle, with a **+** button at the end (spoken label "Add item").

**Acceptance criteria**
- Typing a name and pressing Enter/Done (or +) adds it to the list with quantity 1. The field clears and keeps focus for the next item.
- If the name matches a catalog product (ignoring case and outer spaces) from the products saved on the phone, the item gets that product's price you pay, its category and the catalog icon. Otherwise it has no price and goes to **Other**.
- If the item is already on the list (same name ignoring case and outer spaces), its quantity goes up by 1 instead of adding a second row (maximum 99).
- A message "Kiwi added" offers **Undo** for 5 seconds.
- Empty or spaces-only input does nothing; the field accepts at most 60 characters.
- Works offline: without saved products, everything is added as a typed item.

**Examples on Weekly shop**
- "kiwi" → Kiwi, $2.11, Fruit & veg, catalog icon.
- "Candles" → Candles, no price ("—"), Other.
- "milk" → no new row; Milk becomes × 3.

**Strings**

| Key | English | Spanish | Arabic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Placeholder | Add an item | Añadir un artículo | أضف عنصرًا |
| Message | Kiwi added | Kiwi añadido | تمت إضافة Kiwi |

#### BK-204 · New text · Item count under the list name
*Requested by: PO*

**Why:** in the store people want to know at a glance how much is left.

**Where:** List detail top bar, under the list name.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Shows "10 items · 3 in basket". With nothing ticked: "6 items". An empty list: "No items yet".
- Updates immediately when items are ticked, added or removed.
- Counts are grammatical in every language ("1 item").
- One line; the list name and the subtitle each end with "…" when too long. Works at the largest text size.

**Strings**

| Case | English | Spanish | Arabic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weekly shop | 10 items · 3 in basket | 10 artículos · 3 en la cesta | 10 عناصر · 3 في السلة |
| BBQ Saturday | 6 items | 6 artículos | 6 عناصر |
| Camping trip | No items yet | Sin artículos todavía | لا توجد عناصر بعد |

#### BK-205 · New button · Share a list from the Lists screen
*Requested by: PO*

**Why:** people share the shopping list with a partner without opening it.

**Where:** the ⋮ menu on each list card on **Lists**: Rename, Duplicate, **Share**, Delete.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Opens the system share sheet with exactly the same text as **Share** on List detail (list name, "To buy", "In basket", total).
- Not available for a list with no items (disabled or hidden), and it never crashes.
- Spoken label "Share list".
